PLANETARY SETTLEMENT INDEX
==========================
a minimal log of off-world life


CHAPTER 1 — ARRIVAL
-------------------
You land.
You breathe recycled air.
Gravity feels like a joke that still hurts.

Objective:  SURVIVE
Next step:  stabilize dome pressure
Fail mode:  rapid unplanned terraforming event


CHAPTER 2 — HABITAT LOG
-----------------------
MARS-01  "Lowland Crater"   crew 132   status: stable
MARS-02  "Tube Hollow"      crew  47   status: experimental
LUNA-α   "Farside Array"    crew  23   status: fragile

Rules of thumb:
- if you can see stars, you are probably outside the safe zone
- if you can hear wind, you are definitely outside the safe zone


CHAPTER 3 — SYSTEM STATUS
-------------------------
Life Support:     OK
Food Reserves:    OK (92 days @ current rationing)
Water Extraction: experimental, dusty, loud
Power:            mostly solar, sometimes panic
Governance:       contested
Meaning of Life:  pending review

Failure modes (top 3):
1) no air
2) no water
3) too many meetings


CHAPTER 4 — THE FIRST ARGUMENT
------------------------------
"Who decides who decides?"

First recorded council conflict in MARS-01.
Ten minutes of silence.
Then someone made popcorn and it got worse.

Open questions:
- who owns a sunrise on a different world?
- can you vote yourself back to Earth?
- is boredom a safety risk?


CHAPTER 5 — ETHICS / PHILOSOPHY
-------------------------------
- Does a new world need new sins?
- What does ownership mean without Earth?
- If a child is born here, whose dream is it?
- How much risk can a society sign for unborn people?

Working principle:
    no gods, no heroes, no shareholders —
    only responsibilities.


CHAPTER 6 — MISSION LOG
------------------------
2042-03-01  permanent crew arrival in MARS-01
2042-07-19  sub-horizon ice confirmed
2043-02-08  first off-world birth
2043-11-23  settlement council rejects private land
2044-01-04  first recorded "I miss traffic" in logbook


CHAPTER 7 — NEXT MOVES
----------------------
Phase 1: stabilize underground habitats
Phase 2: local food loops, less Earth dependency
Phase 3: inter-settlement transport corridor
Phase 4: kids who think "Earth" is a nice place to visit

Engineering mantra:
- mass down
- redundancy up
- complexity last


APPENDIX — INDEX
----------------
charter/   baseline rules, airlocks & arguments
habitats/  technical notes, failure stories, fixes
people/    crews, families, what keeps them going


LAST LINE (FOR NOW)
-------------------
"If we fail here, it won’t be because space is hostile.
It’ll be because we packed our old habits better than our tools."
